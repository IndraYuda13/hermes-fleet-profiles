# Weak Password Detection / Credential Brute-Force

Weak or default credentials remain one of the most prevalent and high-impact vulnerabilities. This skill covers systematic detection of weak passwords through dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, system-generated password prediction, and brute-force tooling.

## Attack Surface

- Login portals (web, API, mobile, SSH, FTP, Telnet, RDP)
- Admin panels, dashboards, and management interfaces
- Default or hardcoded credentials in applications and devices
- Self-registration flows with weak password policies
- Password reset flows that generate predictable tokens or passwords
- API key and token authentication with weak secrets

## Reconnaissance

### Identify Authentication Endpoints

- Standard login forms: `/login`, `/signin`, `/auth`, `/authenticate`, `/api/login`
- Admin panels: `/admin`, `/administrator`, `/manage`, `/console`, `/cpanel`
- API auth: `/api/v1/token`, `/oauth/token`, `/api/auth`, `/graphql` (login mutations)
- Service ports: SSH (22), FTP (21), Telnet (23), SMB (445), RDP (3389), MySQL (3306), PostgreSQL (5432), Redis (6379), MongoDB (27017)
- Mobile app login endpoints and deep-link auth handlers

### Determine Authentication Mechanism

- Form-based (POST with username/password fields)
- Basic Authentication (Base64 `Authorization: Basic ...`)
- Bearer token / JWT (password grant flow)
- API key in header, query parameter, or body
- Multi-step authentication (username first, then password)
- CAPTCHA presence and type (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, image-based, math)
- Rate limiting indicators (429 responses, lockout messages, delays)

### Enumerate Valid Usernames

- Error message differentiation: "Invalid username" vs "Invalid password"
- Registration page username availability checks
- Password reset flow: response timing or message leakage
- Public profiles, API responses, or metadata exposing usernames
- Common patterns: `admin`, `administrator`, `root`, `user`, `test`, `guest`, `support`, `service`, `api`, `dev`, `ops`
- Email format derivation from company domain patterns

## Key Vulnerabilities

### Weak Password Policies

- No minimum length or complexity requirements
- Allowing common passwords: `password`, `123456`, `qwerty`, `admin`, `letmein`
- Not checking against breached password databases (Have I Been Pwned)
- Case-insensitive password storage
- No password history enforcement
- Excessively short maximum length (indicates plaintext or weak hashing)

### Default and Hardcoded Credentials

- Vendor defaults: `admin/admin`, `admin/password`, `root/root`, `guest/guest`
- Application frameworks: `django/admin`, `tomcat/tomcat`, `weblogic/weblogic`
- IoT devices, routers, cameras: manufacturer-specific defaults
- Database defaults: `postgres/postgres`, `sa/sa`, `root/(empty)`
- Cloud defaults: AWS instance metadata, Azure default service principals
- Hardcoded in source code, configuration files, or documentation

### Credential Stuffing

- Users reuse passwords across services
- Breached credential lists (COMB, Collection #1-5, etc.) enable mass account takeover
- No multi-factor authentication allows direct access with valid credentials
- Missing breach detection or forced password rotation after known leaks

### Predictable System-Generated Passwords

- Sequential or pattern-based: `Password1`, `Welcome2025!`, `CompanyName123`
- Time-based generation: passwords derived from registration timestamp
- Weak randomness: predictable PRNG seeds in password generators
- Reset tokens that double as temporary passwords with short expiration

### Brute-Force Vulnerabilities

- No rate limiting on login attempts
- Absent or ineffective account lockout (client-side only, easily bypassed)
- IP-based blocking without session/user correlation (rotate IPs via proxy)
- CAPTCHA bypassable or only triggered after excessive attempts
- Parallel login attempts not tracked (race conditions on attempt counters)
- Verbose error messages revealing valid usernames

## Advanced Techniques

### Targeted Password Lists

- Generate custom wordlists from:
  - Company name, product names, and domain components
  - Geographic location, industry terms
  - Season + year patterns: `Summer2025!`, `Winter2026@`
  - Keyboard walks and leet speak variations
  - Previously breached passwords for the target domain
- Scrape the target site to build a content-derived wordlist (e.g. a small custom Python crawler that harvests unique words)

### Credential Stuffing Workflows

- Use breach databases filtered by target domain or related domains
- Test email:password pairs where email matches target domain
- Test username:password pairs with common username derivations
- Validate successful logins without triggering MFA by checking session endpoints

### Multi-Step Authentication Bypass

- Username enumeration → password brute-force on second step
- Session fixation between steps: manipulate step identifiers
- Skip steps via direct URL access to later stages
- Response manipulation to bypass verification checks

### API and Mobile-Specific

- GraphQL login mutations: batch brute-force via array inputs
- Mobile APIs often lack rate limiting compared to web frontends
- JWT password grant flows: brute-force against `/token` endpoint
- OAuth2 password grant: test `grant_type=password` with weak credentials

### Service-Level Brute-Force

- HTTP login endpoints: `ffuf` or custom scripts (see Tooling)
- SSH/FTP/SMB/Telnet and other services: `nmap` NSE `*-brute` scripts, e.g. `nmap -p 22 --script ssh-brute --script-args userdb=users.txt,passdb=passwords.txt target.com`
- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis): weak/default credentials via the matching NSE brute script (`mysql-brute`, `pgsql-brute`, `mongodb-brute`, `redis-brute`) or a custom client script
- Any protocol lacking a ready script: custom Python

## Tooling

### ffuf (primary for web logins)

- Login brute-force with multiple users and passwords:
  `ffuf -w users.txt:USER -w passwords.txt:PASS -u https://target.com/login -X POST -d "username=USER&password=PASS" -fr "Invalid"`
- JSON body / custom headers via `-H` and a JSON `-d` payload
- Filter by response size, status code, or regex to identify successes

### nmap NSE (service brute-force)

- `*-brute` scripts cover many non-HTTP services:
  `nmap -p 22 --script ssh-brute --script-args userdb=users.txt,passdb=passwords.txt target.com`
- Available scripts include `ssh-brute`, `ftp-brute`, `smb-brute`, `telnet-brute`, `mysql-brute`, `pgsql-brute`, `mongodb-brute`, `redis-brute`, `http-brute`, `http-form-brute`.

### Custom Python Scripts

- Use `requests` with threading for high-speed API brute-force
- Implement jitter and proxy rotation to evade rate limiting
- Parse CSRF tokens dynamically between requests

### Offline hash cracking (leaked unsalted MD5)

When SQLi (or a backup) dumps a password column as raw binary, read it as `HEX(col)` and crack
it locally — a raw 16-byte value is usually an unsalted MD5 (`hashcat -m 0`). Ladder, stop at the
first stage that hits:

1. **Derivation + online first (cheap).** In Python, test whether the hash equals `md5(username)`,
   `md5(NRP/ID)`, a `pc`-suffix-stripped variant, or a trivial transform. In parallel try an online
   reverse lookup (nitrxgen, hashtoolkit) to catch common passwords instantly.
2. **`hashcat -a 0 -m 0 -O hashes.txt rockyou.txt`**, then add `-r best64.rule`, then
   `-r rockyou-30000.rule`.
3. **Heavy rules last:** `d3ad0ne.rule`, `dive.rule`, `T0XlC.rule`, `InsidePro-PasswordsPro.rule`.
4. **Numeric/pattern masks** for pins/birthdays/NRP: `-a 3 ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d`.

Rules of thumb:
- Reverse-lookup sites frequently return 403 / rate-limit from a datacenter IP. A 403 is the
  service blocking you, NOT proof the password is strong — always run the local hashcat pass too.
- **Duplicate hashes are signal.** If several accounts map to one hash, check whether those
  accounts are the SAME person (a base account and a `...pc` workstation account). Identical hashes
  across one person's own accounts means a per-user key, not a shared public password — do not
  misread it as a "default password" finding.
- 0 hits after dictionary + rules + masks on an unsalted MD5 almost always means machine-generated
  passwords. Say "offline crack infeasible — needs live credentials or source access" rather than
  grinding more rules, and **STOP hashcat once strategies repeat** (kill the process — on a shared
  host never leave it burning CPU indefinitely).

### Wordlists

No password wordlists ship in the sandbox by default — download what you need into `/home/pentester/tools/wordlists` at runtime:
- Common passwords (e.g. `rockyou.txt`) from its upstream source
- SecLists `Passwords/` and `Passwords/Default-Credentials/` (vendor defaults) from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
- Custom lists from target-specific scraping
- Breach compilation subsets filtered by target relevance

## Validation

1. Confirm successful login with captured credentials (session token, cookie, or JWT)
2. Verify account access level: admin vs user privileges
3. Check if MFA is enforced post-login or can be bypassed
4. Test credential reuse across other endpoints or services
5. Document password policy weaknesses that allowed the breach
6. Verify if the same credentials work on staging, dev, or related domains

## False Positives

- Honey accounts or honeypot responses designed to mislead attackers
- Temporary lockouts that resolve quickly (distinguish from permanent bans)
- Different error messages that don't actually indicate valid username enumeration
- CAPTCHA or WAF blocking that appears as a failed login
- Rate limiting that returns 429 instead of 401 (adjust timing)

## Impact

- Complete account takeover for affected users
- Administrative access leading to full system compromise
- Lateral movement via reused credentials across services
- Data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and persistence
- Reputational damage and compliance violations (GDPR, PCI-DSS)

## Pro Tips

1. Always start with default credentials and vendor-specific lists before broad brute-force
2. Enumerate usernames first; password brute-force without valid users is inefficient
3. Use small, targeted wordlists before massive lists like rockyou.txt
4. Monitor for rate limiting and adapt delays; aggressive brute-force causes IP bans and alerts
5. Test for password spraying (one password, many users) before targeted brute-force
6. Check for concurrent session limits; successful logins may kick out legitimate users
7. GraphQL batching can test multiple credentials in a single request, bypassing per-request limits
8. Document the password policy and recommend minimum standards (length, complexity, breach checking)
9. For web logins prefer `ffuf`; for other services use `nmap` NSE `*-brute` scripts or custom scripts with equivalent logic
10. Combine with MFA testing: weak passwords plus missing MFA is a critical finding

## Summary

Weak password detection requires systematic enumeration of authentication surfaces, intelligent wordlist selection, and careful brute-force execution. The highest impact often comes from default credentials, password spraying, and credential stuffing rather than exhaustive brute-force. Always validate findings with confirmed logins and assess the full scope of account compromise.
