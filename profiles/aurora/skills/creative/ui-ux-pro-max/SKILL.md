# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Searchable database of UI/UX design rules with priority-based recommendations: 84 styles, 192 color palettes, 74 font pairings, 192 product types with reasoning rules, 98 UX guidelines, 104 icon entries, 16 GSAP motion presets, and 25 chart types across 22 technology stacks.

## When to Apply

Use this Skill when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**: designing new pages, creating/refactoring UI components, choosing color/typography/spacing/layout systems, reviewing UI for UX/accessibility/consistency, implementing navigation/animation/responsive behavior, or improving perceived quality and usability.

Skip it for pure backend logic, API/database design, non-visual performance work, infrastructure/DevOps, or non-visual scripts — unless the task changes how something **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**.

## Rule Categories by Priority

*Follow priority 1→10 to decide which category to focus on first; use `--domain <Domain>` to query full details. The full rule text for every category lives in `references/quick-reference.md` — read it on demand rather than loading it every time.*

| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain | Key Checks (Must Have) | Anti-Patterns (Avoid) |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | `ux` | Contrast 4.5:1, Alt text, Keyboard nav, Aria-labels | Removing focus rings, Icon-only buttons without labels |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | `ux` | Min size 44×44px, 8px+ spacing, Loading feedback | Reliance on hover only, Instant state changes (0ms) |
| 3 | Performance | HIGH | `ux` | WebP/AVIF, Lazy loading, Reserve space (CLS &lt; 0.1) | Layout thrashing, Cumulative Layout Shift |
| 4 | Style Selection | HIGH | `style`, `product` | Match product type, Consistency, SVG icons (no emoji) | Mixing flat & skeuomorphic randomly, Emoji as icons |
| 5 | Layout & Responsive | HIGH | `ux` | Mobile-first breakpoints, Viewport meta, No horizontal scroll | Horizontal scroll, Fixed px container widths, Disable zoom |
| 6 | Typography & Color | MEDIUM | `typography`, `color` | Base 16px, Line-height 1.5, Semantic color tokens | Text &lt; 12px body, Gray-on-gray, Raw hex in components |
| 7 | Animation | MEDIUM | `ux`, `gsap` | Duration 150–300ms, Motion conveys meaning, Spatial continuity | Decorative-only animation, Animating width/height, No reduced-motion |
| 8 | Forms & Feedback | MEDIUM | `ux` | Visible labels, Error near field, Helper text, Progressive disclosure | Placeholder-only label, Errors only at top, Overwhelm upfront |
| 9 | Navigation Patterns | HIGH | `ux` | Predictable back, Bottom nav ≤5, Deep linking | Overloaded nav, Broken back behavior, No deep links |
| 10 | Charts & Data | LOW | `chart` | Legends, Tooltips, Accessible colors | Relying on color alone to convey meaning |

For the full rule list per category (all ~98 UX guidelines with rationale), read `references/quick-reference.md`. For app-specific polish rules (icons, touch feedback, dark mode contrast, safe areas) and the canonical pre-delivery checklist, read `references/pro-rules.md`.

## Running the search tool

The search script lives inside this skill's own directory, not the project directory. Always invoke it by its full path — do not assume a particular working directory:

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/creative/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --domain <domain>
```

If `python` is not found, try `python3`, then `py -3`. Requires Python 3.x, no external dependencies (see README for install instructions if Python is missing).

## Workflow

### Art-direction boundary

The database is a **retrieval aid**, not an art director. For open-ended Depth 2/3 work, establish product truth, product mechanism/proof, candidate composition hypotheses, and likely category defaults through `visual-authoring-core` **before** allowing `--design-system`, style, color, typography, landing, or GSAP results to influence the direction.

Database outputs are candidate ingredients. They may answer a bounded uncertainty, pressure-test a direction, or suggest implementation guidance. They may not select the shell, aesthetic family, palette/effect cluster, or typography pairing merely because the search ranks it highly.

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract from the user request:
- **Product type**: SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, dashboard, entertainment, tool, productivity, or hybrid
- **Target audience & context**: age group, usage context (commute, leisure, work)
- **Product mechanism/proof**: the real behavior, artifact, content or workflow the interface should make visible
- **Likely defaults**: shell/hero/card/type/color/motion patterns the category or framework would produce automatically
- **Tone/style words**: treat playful, vibrant, minimal, dark, immersive, etc. as constraints to interpret after product truth, not as a substitute for a visual thesis
- **Stack**: detect from the project — check `package.json` deps (react/next/vue/svelte/nuxt/@angular), `pubspec.yaml` (Flutter), `*.xcodeproj`/`Package.swift` (SwiftUI), `composer.json` (Laravel), or React Native markers (`app.json` + `react-native` dep). If nothing is detectable, ask the user or default to `html-tailwind`. **Never assume a stack** — a hardcoded default silently misroutes every recommendation.

### Step 2: Query Candidate Design-System Guidance

For a new page/project, use `--design-system` **after** the visual thesis/candidate has been framed. For Depth 0/1 or an established product system, it can be the first broad retrieval step because the visual authority already exists.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

This searches product/style/color/landing/typography domains in parallel, applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv`, and returns **candidate** pattern/style/color/typography/effect guidance plus anti-patterns. Compare the result to product truth and `DEFAULT_DEBT.md`; reject ranked recommendations that simply reproduce category/model defaults.

**Example:**
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "beauty spa wellness service" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```

### Step 2b: Persist Design System (Master + Overrides Pattern)

Persist only after the guidance has been reconciled with the accepted project direction. For Depth 2/3, do not persist raw search output before rendered direction selection/LENS acceptance. Once accepted, add `--persist` **and always pass `--output-dir` pointed at the project root** — without it, files are written relative to whatever directory the tool happens to run from:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name" --output-dir "<project-root>"
```

This creates:
- `design-system/<project-slug>/MASTER.md` — Global Source of Truth
- `design-system/<project-slug>/pages/` — Folder for page-specific overrides

With a page-specific override, add `--page "dashboard"` to also create `design-system/<project-slug>/pages/dashboard.md`.

If `design-system/<project-slug>/MASTER.md` already exists, `--persist` **skips writing and leaves it untouched** unless you also pass `--force` — check whether it exists first (and read it) before regenerating, so you don't silently discard prior decisions the user or a teammate made.

**Retrieval when building a specific page:**
1. Read `design-system/<project-slug>/MASTER.md`
2. Check if `design-system/<project-slug>/pages/<page-name>.md` exists — if so, its rules override Master
3. Otherwise use Master rules exclusively

### Step 2c: Design Dials (optional)

Three optional 1-10 sliders that tune `--design-system` output without changing your query. Add any combination of them to the same command:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<query>" --design-system --variance <1-10> --motion <1-10> --density <1-10>
```

| Dial | Low (1-3) | Mid (4-7) | High (8-10) |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `--variance` | Centered / minimal (biases toward Minimalism-style categories) | Balanced / modern | Bold / asymmetric (biases toward Brutalism, Bento Grids) |
| `--motion` | Subtle micro-interactions | Standard scroll/stagger motion | Complex choreography (pin, Flip, SplitText) |
| `--density` | Spacious (24-96px spacing scale) | Standard (16-64px, current default) | Dense/dashboard (8-32px spacing scale) |

- `--motion` attaches a ready-to-use GSAP snippet (with framework notes, Do/Don't, and performance notes) pulled from `--domain gsap`, matched to the resolved tier (Subtle/Standard/Complex).
- `--density` overrides the `--space-*` CSS variable table in the ASCII/markdown/MASTER.md output — use it for dashboards (high) vs. marketing pages (low) without hand-editing tokens.
- Leaving a dial unset keeps that part of the output exactly as it was before (no behavior change).
- Dial labels describe **search bias**, not quality. High variance does not mean "use brutalism/bento"; high motion does not mean decorative choreography. Accept a returned style/motion only when the product mechanism and design contract earn it.

**Example:**
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "internal analytics dashboard" --design-system --variance 8 --motion 7 --density 8 -p "Ops Console"
```

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

| Need | Domain | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Product type patterns | `product` | `--domain product "entertainment social"` |
| More style options | `style` | `--domain style "industrial operations precise dense"` |
| Color palettes | `color` | `--domain color "entertainment vibrant"` |
| Font pairings | `typography` | `--domain typography "playful modern"` |
| Individual Google Fonts | `google-fonts` | `--domain google-fonts "sans serif popular variable"` |
| Chart recommendations | `chart` | `--domain chart "real-time dashboard"` |
| UX best practices | `ux` | `--domain ux "animation accessibility"` |
| Landing page structure | `landing` | `--domain landing "hero social-proof"` |
| Icon recommendations | `icons` | `--domain icons "navigation outline"` |
| GSAP animation presets | `gsap` | `--domain gsap "scroll reveal stagger"` |
| React/Next.js performance | `react` | `--domain react "rerender memo list"` |
| App/native interface guidelines | `web` | `--domain web "accessibilityLabel touch safe-areas"` |

Domain is auto-detected from the query if `--domain` is omitted — but auto-detection can misroute overlapping terms (e.g. "font" matches both `typography` and `google-fonts`). If results look off-topic, pass `--domain` explicitly.

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<keyword>" --stack <stack>
```

**Available stacks:** `react`, `nextjs`, `vue`, `svelte`, `astro`, `nuxtjs`, `nuxt-ui`, `angular`, `laravel`, `swiftui`, `react-native`, `flutter`, `jetpack-compose`, `html-tailwind`, `shadcn`, `threejs`, `javafx`, `wpf`, `winui`, `avalonia`, `uno`, `uwp`. Use the stack detected in Step 1.

---

## If a search returns 0 results

Do not fabricate output. Instead:
1. Retry once with broader or differently-worded keywords (try product + style separately rather than combined).
2. If still empty, fall back to the priority table and project/product evidence. Label the guidance as general. **Do not substitute "general SaaS defaults" for a missing match** on open-ended design work; that is exactly where generic output enters.
3. Never present a 0-result search as if it returned data.

## Example Workflow

**User request:** "Make an AI search homepage." (stack detected as Next.js from `package.json`)

```bash
# Step 2: design system
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "AI search tool modern minimal" --design-system -p "AI Search"

# Step 3: supplement
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "search loading animation" --domain ux

# Step 4: stack guidelines
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "suspense streaming bundle" --stack nextjs
```

Then synthesize the design system + detailed searches and implement.

## Output Formats

`--design-system` supports `-f ascii` (default, terminal display), `-f markdown` (documentation), and `--json` (machine-readable, includes the raw design system dict plus persistence status).

## Tips for Better Results

- Use **multi-dimensional keywords** — combine product + industry + tone + density: `"entertainment social vibrant content-dense"`, not just `"app"`
- Prefer queries that name a product/usage constraint plus the design uncertainty: `"industrial monitoring dense low-fatigue"`, `"consumer creator playful mobile"`, `"editorial archive image-led"`.
- Use `--design-system` first for full recommendations, then `--domain` to deep-dive any dimension you're unsure about
- Pass the detected stack explicitly for implementation-specific guidance

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| Can't decide on style/color | Re-run `--design-system` with different keywords |
| Dark mode contrast issues | `references/quick-reference.md` §6: `color-dark-mode` + `color-accessible-pairs` |
| Animations feel unnatural | `references/quick-reference.md` §7: `spring-physics` + `easing` + `exit-faster-than-enter` |
| Form UX is poor | `references/quick-reference.md` §8: `inline-validation` + `error-clarity` + `focus-management` |
| Navigation feels confusing | `references/quick-reference.md` §9: `nav-hierarchy` + `bottom-nav-limit` + `back-behavior` |
| Layout breaks on small screens | `references/quick-reference.md` §5: `mobile-first` + `breakpoint-consistency` |
| Performance / jank | `references/quick-reference.md` §3: `virtualize-lists` + `main-thread-budget` + `debounce-throttle` |

## Before Delivering App UI

Read `references/pro-rules.md` and run through its canonical Pre-Delivery Checklist. It covers icon/visual-element discipline, interaction feedback, light/dark contrast, safe-area layout, and accessibility — scoped to native/mobile app UI (iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter).
